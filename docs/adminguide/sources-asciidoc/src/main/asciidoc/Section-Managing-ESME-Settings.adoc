= External Short Messaging Entities (ESMEs)

{this-platform} {this-application} can now act as ESME (initiate bind to remote SMSC - Client type ESME) or can also act as SMSC (accept bind from remote ESME - Server type ESME). While defining an ESME (SMPP connection), you can optionally pass the Cluster name.
If it is not passed, cluster name is same as ESME name.
As the name suggests, its now possible to group different ESMEs in the same cluster.
This is useful only when SMS is suppose to be routed out of {this-platform} {this-application} to ESME. If there are multiple ESME's in a cluster, the load is shared in a round robin fashion to send out SMS. In case if one of the ESME is in `UNBOUND` state, the next `BOUND` smpp connection (within same cluster) will be used.

The current algo for routing is the following. We have two steps:

* 1 step - selecting ESME cluster for delivering. Each cluster can contain one or more ESME. The idea of cluster usage is to have load sharing between nodes (ESMEs) inside a cluster and/or if some cluster node is unbound then SMSC GW will send messages to another cluster. SMSC GW selects the first cluster that ESME(s) fits to the conditions:
**   bindType==transiever or receiver (for SERVER type) or transmitter (for CLIENT type)
**   the ESME is not the ESME from which the message has come to SMSC GW
**   networkID of a message == networkID of an ESME
**   dest address, ton and npi of a message fit to routing address, ton and npi of ESME. The fact if this ESME is bound or not is not taken into account at this step
* 2 step - selecting of ESME in the cluster:
**   selecting of ESME in the cluster that is bound (and not stopped) now. If all ESMEs are not bound in the cluster then the message will be dropped (temporary delivery failure)

In order to this algo works properly we need to specify same "routing-ton", "routing-npi" and "routing-range" parameters for all ESMEs in a cluster.

Below diagram explains the load-balancing between SMPP connections

.SMPP Load Balancing

You can define multiple ESMEs, each with a unique name but the same `systemId` and declare their `host-ip` and `port` values as -1 (only for SMPP type Server). The SMSC will now accept multiple incoming BIND requests from any `IP` and any `port` as far as the `systemId` and `Password` matches.

Alternatively, if you declare a real value for `host-ip` (say for example 10.199.7.23) and `port` as -1, the SMSC will accept as many BINDS as ESMEs defined from the specified IP but any port as far as the `systemId` and `Password` matches.

Additionally, if sending queue through one of ESMEs in cluster will grow high (what's high is specified with ESME overloadThreshold property), SMSC will stop routing new messages through this ESME and will send them through other ESMEs in same cluster if available or store in database until after queue will drop to a normal size (specified by ESME property 'normalThreshold').

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to configure a new ESME.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	Name			- A unique name for this ESME configuration. You can
				  define as many ESMEs as you want as far as the name is
				  unique and the combination of
				  SystemId:host-ip:port:SmppBindType is unique.

	System Id		- This is used to identify an ESME or an SMSC at bind
				  time. An 'ESME system_id' identifies the ESME or ESME
				  agent to the SMSC. The 'SMSC system_id' provides an
				  identification of the SMSC to the ESME. You can define
				  multiple ESMEs, each with a unique name but the same
				  <literal>systemId<literal> to allow anonymous incoming
				  binds and multiple binds from the same IP depending on
				  the values specified for host-ip and port.

	host-ip	& port		- If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, the BIND request will
				  be sent to the configured IP and Port. If the SMSC is
				  acting as a Server, it will accept incoming BIND
				  requests from the specified IP and Port.
				  If the port is unknown, you must pass '-1' as wild
				  character.

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip and port values are -1 (for SMPP type Server),
				  the SMSC will accept multiple incoming BIND requests
			          from any IP:port as long as the systemId and password
				  match.

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip is a real value (a specific IP) and port value
				  is -1, the SMSC will accept as many BINDS as ESMEs
				  defined from the specified IP but any port as long as
				  the systemId and password match.

	SmppBindType 		- Possible values: TRANSCEIVER, TRANSMITTER or RECEIVER.
				  If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, it will initiate
				  corresponding bind. If the SMSC is acting as a Server,
				  it will accept corresponding bind from a remote ESME.

	SmppSession.Type 	- Possible values: SERVER or CLIENT.
				  If the value is 'SERVER', the SMSC acts as a Server
				  listening for incoming SMPP binds.
				  If the value is 'CLIENT', the SMSC will initiate
				  SMPP bind to a remote Server.

	Optional Parameters

	Password	    - It is used by the SMSC to authenticate the identity of
				  the binding ESME. The Service Provider may require
				  ESMEвЂ™s to provide a password when binding to the SMSC.

	networkId       - indicates virtual subnetwork that this ESME belongs. SMS
	                flows within same netwrokId, unless changed using mproc
	                (this is for multi-tenancy support). If this parameter is
                    skipped - networkId will be set to "0" when ESME creation.
                    If you do not use multi-tenancy support - set this value
                    to 0 or skip.

	split-long-messages - long messages will be split before sending to this
				  ESME destination. Default value is false.

	system-type     - Default value is null.
				  This is used to categorize the type of ESME that is
				  binding to the SMSC.

	interface-version	- Default value is 3.4.

				  It is used to indicate the version of the SMPP protocol.

				  It is set in 'SMPPServer Settings'.

	esme-ton 		- Defines ESME TON. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this TON will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same TON as configured here. If the configured
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	esme-npi 		- Defines ESME NPI. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this NPI will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same NPI as configured here. If the configured
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	esme-range 		- Defines ESME Address Range. If the SMPP Session Type is
				  CLIENT, this Address Range will be used in the BIND
				  request. If the SMPP Session Type is SERVER, the
				  incoming BIND request should have the same Address Range
				  as configured here. If the configured value is
				  null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	cluster-name 		- If it is not specified then its same as the name.
				  It is possible to group different SMPP connections
				  together by specifying the same cluster-name.
				  All the SMPP connection's that are capable of sending
				  out SMS are candidates for grouping.

	window-size 		- Default value is 1.
				  The window size is the amount of unacknowledged requests
				  that are permitted to be outstanding/unacknowledged at
				  any given time. If more requests are added, the
				  underlying stack will throw an exception.

				  This value is set only when ESME is defined as Client
				  side. For Server side this value is taken from the
				  'SMPP Server Settings'.

	connect-timeout		- Default value is 10000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the time within which
				  the connection to a remote SMSC server should be
				  established.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	request-expiry-timeout	- Default value is -1 (disabled).
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait in
				  milli seconds for an endpoint to respond to before it
				  expires.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	client-bind-timeout  - Default value is 5000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the length of time
				  to wait for a bind response when the client connecting.
				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.

	window-monitor-interval	- Default value is -1 (disabled).
				  This parameter is used to specify the time between
				  executions of monitoring the window for requests that
				  expire. It is recommended that this value, generally,
				  either matches or is half the value of
				  'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
				  scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the
				  'requestExpiryTimeout' to clear out.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	window-wait-timeout 	- Default value is 60000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait
				  until a slot opens up in the 'sendWindow'.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	counters-enabled 	- Default value is true.
				  When this is enabled, SMSC exposes the statistics for
				  SMPP connections.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	enquire-link-delay	- Default value is 30000 milli seconds.
				  When SMSC connects to a remote server as CLIENT, it
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured
				  enquire-link-delay.

				  0 means disabled. SMSC will not send ENQUIRE_LINK.

	enquire-link-delay-server - Default value is 0 milli seconds.
				  When SMSC connects to a remote server as SERVER, it
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured
				  enquire-link-delay-server.

				  0 means disabled. SMSC will not send ENQUIRE_LINK.

	link-drop-server - Default value is 0 milli seconds means disabled.
				  When SMSC connects to a remote server as SERVER, if it
				  isn't received any data after configured link-drop-server,
				  it will drop the esme session.

				  0 means disabled, SMSC will not drop smpp session.

				  If enquire-link-delay-server is enabled then link-drop-server
				  always disabled.

	charging-enabled	- Flag to enable or disable charging for every SMS
				  arriving from SIP.

	source-ton		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_ton' as the value configured here.

				  If this configured value is null(-1) or not null and
				  matches, the SMSC will compare the
				  'source_addr_npi' and 'source_addr_range' as explained
				  below.

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this SMS with
				  an error code '0x0000000A' indicating
				  Invalid Source Address.

	source-npi		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_npi' as the value configured here.
				  configured here.

				  If this configured value is null(-1)
				  or not null and matches, the SMSC will compare the
				  'source_addr_range' as below.

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating
				  Invalid Source Address.

	source-range		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_range' as the value configured
				  here.This is a regular java expression and
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*.

				  If it matches, the SMSC will accept the incoming SMS
				  and process further.

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating
				  Invalid Source Address.

	routing-ton		- The DefaultSmsRoutingRule will try to match the
				  'dest_addr_ton' of outgoing SMS with the value
				  configured here. If this configured value is null(-1)
				  or not null and matches, the SMSC will compare the
				  'dest_addr_npi' and 'destination_addr' as explained
				  below. If it doesn't match, the SMSC will select the
				  next ESME in the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

				  'destination_addr' of outgoing SMS with the value
				  configured here. This is a regular java expression and
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*. If it matches, the SMSC
				  will send the SMS out over this SMPP connection. If it
				  doesn't match, the SMSC will select the next ESME in
				  the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

    ratelimit_second    - This parameter is used to specify a maximum limit
    				of messages that the SMSC will accept from this ESME
    				during any one second.

    				If the ESME sends more messages (per second)

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the settings of an existing ESME configuration.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	Name			- The name of the ESME that is being modified.

	Optional Parameters

	Password		- Specify the new password.
				  It is used by the SMSC to authenticate the identity of

				  ESMEs to provide a password when binding to the SMSC.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	networkId       - indicates virtual subnetwork that this ESME belongs. SMS
	                flows within same netwrokId, unless changed using mproc
	                (this is for multi-tenancy support). If this parameter is
                    skipped - networkId will be set to "0" when ESME creation.
                    If you do not use multi-tenancy support - set this value
                    to 0 or skip.

	split-long-messages - long messages will be split before sending to this
				  ESME destination. Default value is false.

	esme-ton 		- Specify new ESME TON.
				  If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this TON will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same TON as configured here. If the configured
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	esme-npi 		- Specify new ESME NPI.
				  If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this NPI will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same NPI as configured here. If the configured
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	esme-range 		- Specify ESME Address Range.
				  If the SMPP Session Type is
				  CLIENT, this Address Range will be used in the BIND
				  request. If the SMPP Session Type is SERVER, the

				  as configured here. If the configured value is
				  null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	window-size 		- Specify new window size.
				  Default value is 1.
				  The window size is the amount of unacknowledged requests
				  that are permitted to be outstanding/unacknowledged at
				  any given time. If more requests are added, the
				  underlying stack will throw an exception.

				  This value is set only when ESME is defined as Client
				  side. For Server side this value is taken from the
				  'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	connect-timeout		- Default value is 10000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the time within which
				  the connection to a remote SMSC server should be
				  established.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side.
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.
