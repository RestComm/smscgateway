[NOTE]
====
{this-platform} {this-application} doesn't persist the statistics, hence the data collected for the campaign period refreshes for every defined 'Duration'. You must refresh the page for every 'Duration' period to gather statistics data for the previous time period. 

Nevertheless you can also click on the 'Metrics' link on left panel, select the Campaign and observe the statistics graph.
The metrics page gathers data from the time the page was loaded till user navigates away.
Hence graph will show historic data from the point the page was loaded. 
====

Metrics will show 3 graphs for Messages coming in, Messages attempted for delivery and Messages successfully delivered.
