Name
	smpp smppserver set bindipaddress

SYNOPSIS
	smpp smppserver set bindipaddress <ip-address>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the IP for SMPP server.
	The SMSC server will use this ip for listening incoming bind request from SMPP client.

SYNOPSIS
	smpp smppserver set bindtimeout <bind-timeout>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a value for bind-timeout in milli-seconds. 
	Once the TCP socket is established, the SMSC server will wait for the time period 
	specified by the parameter bind-timeout in milli-seconds, for the peer to send a 
	bind request, after which it will kill the TCP socket.

	If unspecified, the default value is 5000 milli-seconds.

SYNOPSIS
	smpp smppserver set autonegotiateversion <true/false>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify if auto-negotiate-version is enabled or not.
	If it is set to 'true' and a Bind is received with version <= 3.3 for

	smpp smppserver set defaultwindowwaittimeout <default-window-wait-timeout>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-window-wait-timeout for this Server
	in milli-seconds. 
	The window wait timeout is the time within which the connection to remote SMSC
	Server should be established.

	The default value is 30000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-window-monitor-interval for the Server 
	in milli-seconds. This is the time between executions of monitoring the window for
	requests that expire. It is recommended that this value, generally, either matches 
	or is half the value of 'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
	scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the 'requestExpiryTimeout' to 
	clear out.

	The default value is 15000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----
