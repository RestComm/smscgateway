            <title>SMSC Gateway</title>
            <para>SMSC (Short Message Service Center) is a telecommunications network facility responsible for handling the SMS operations of a wireless network. When a subscriber sends an SMS message from a mobile phone, the message first reaches the SMS Center which then forwards the message to the desired destination. The SMS Center is responsible for routing the SMS messages and regulating the process. If the recipient is not reachable (the phone is switched off or out of coverage area etc.) the SMS Center will store the message to a database and forward it to the recipient when available. Messages that are delivered successfully and messages that failed to be delivered are stored in an archive database for logging purposes.</para>

            		<itemizedlist> 
				<listitem>
					<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can handle mobile originated SMS and deliver them to the intended recipient (mobile, ESME or SIP).
					It also provides a flexible routing mechanism to route messages to/from ESME over SMPP protocol. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports normal style (Server side) SMPP connection.
					It can also act as ESME initiating connection to third party SMSC (Client side). Submit_Sm, Data_Sm, Submit_Multi and Deliver_Sm messages are supported.
					</para>

              	  		<listitem>
					<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports SIP connection through JSLEE SIP RA.
					</para>
				</listitem>
                		<listitem>
					<para>For incoming from SMPP ESME messages, &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports StoreAndForward, Datagramm and Transactional modes and a special ForwardAndStore mode for reducing the database load. </para>
					<para>When a message comes from SMPP, the &THIS.APPLICATION; checks the <literal>EsmClass</literal> field in the SMPP message. For Datagramm and Transactional modes, the SMSC will try to immediately deliver the message to a destination. If it is in Transactional mode, the SMSC will also return a delivery result (success/failure) to the ESME. Such messages are not stored in the Cassandra database. In case of delivery failure the message will be dropped and no more delivery attempts will be made.</para>
					<para>
If the <literal>EsmClass</literal> field indicates StoreAndForward (or default) mode, more than one attempt will be made to deliver the message (if the first attempt fails). Such messages will be stored in the Cassandra database. The &THIS.APPLICATION; can be configured in two modes for processing of StoreAndForward messages as shown below:
					<variablelist>
						<varlistentry>
						<term>StoreAndForward (normal) mode</term>
						<listitem><para>In the StoreAndForward mode, an incoming "StoreAndForward" message will always be stored in a database and scheduled for delivery after few seconds. This mode is fully compliant with SMPP specification. </para></listitem>
						</varlistentry>
					</variablelist>
					<variablelist>
						<varlistentry>
						<term>ForwardAndStore (fast) mode</term>
						<listitem><para>In the ForwardAndStore mode, an incoming "StoreAndForward" message will be attempted for delivery immediately, without storing in the database and therefore without any delay. If this first delivery attempt fails, the message will be stored in a database for futher scheduling.
</para></listitem>
						</varlistentry>
					</variablelist>
					</para>
				</listitem> 
                <listitem>

					<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can be configured for congestion control to reject messages when the number of messages in processing exceeds a configurable limit (<literal>MaxActivityCount</literal>). </para>
					<para>When the SMSC is configured in ForwardAndStore (fast) mode, SMPP originated messages will be first rejected. Then when the number of messages in processing further increases, SIP originated messages will be rejected and finally SS7 originated messages will be rejected. </para>
					<para>When SMSC is configured in StoreAndForward (normal) mode, only datagramm and transactional SMPP originated messages will be rejected. However StoreAndForward messages and all SS7/SIP originated messages will be stored in the Cassandra database and the scheduling for delivery of these messages will be stopped until the number of messages in processing does not exceed the configured limit.

            <para>
				IP Short Message Gateway (IP-SM-GW), which is in line with relevant 3GPP 23.824 specifications, acts as a bridge managing the origination and termination of SMS messages between circuit-switched and IP-based networks (over SIP). With this solution, mobile operators can make use of existing messaging platforms such as short message service centers (SMSCs) to deliver IP-based messaging. The IP-SM-GW is also essential for rolling out rich communication services (RCS), which enable operators to deliver sticky messaging services like presence-enabled address book, SIP-based chat services and mobile instant messaging.
			</para>
			<para>
				RestComm SMSC has support for SIP messagaing and can send short messages from SIP to SS7 or ESME and vice-a-versa. RestComm SMSC can easily be integarted with RestComm RestComm via SIP to enable developers to rapidly build voice, video, WebRTC, USSD, SMS, fax and rich messaging applications.
