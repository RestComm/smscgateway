SYNOPSIS
	smsc set defaultvalidityperiodhours <default-validity-period-hours>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a value for default validity period (in hours) for 
	incoming SMSC messages that do not have their own validity period value. Validity 
	period is the time duration for which the SMSC Gateway will attempt to
	send the SMS. If the time period expires before the message can be delivered, 
	the SMSC Gateway will drop it.

SYNOPSIS
    smsc set smppencodingforgsm7 <UTF8|UNICODE|GSM7>
	smsc set smppencodingforucs2 <UTF8|UNICODE|GSM7>

DESCRIPTION
    These commands are used to set the Encoding Scheme at SMPP side for
    different GSM data coding schemas (DCS). 
    
    For GSM7 encoding (DCS = 0) you must use the command 
    smsc set smppencodingforgsm7, in order to set text encoding style. 
    
    For UCS2 encoding (DCS = 8), you must use the command
    smsc set smppencodingforucs2, in order to set text encoding style.
    
    At the SMPP side, messages accept 3 different encoding schemes namely UTF8,
    UNICODE and GSM7 (8-bit), for both sending and receiving messages. The SMSC
    can be configured to accept one of them (the one that ESME supports). If this
    is not set, then the default encoding sheme is UTF8. For GSM8 encoding (DCS = 4),
    no charset encoding made in the SMSC.

	smsc set smppencodingforgsm7 utf8

	storeandforwordmode has two possible values:
	
	normal - StoreAndForward mode is used for incoming 
	smpp StoreAndForward messages and all SS7 and SIP messages. All 
	the incoming messages into SMSC will be persisted before trying
	for delivery.

	fast (default) - ForwardAndStore mode is used for incoming smpp
	StoreAndForward messages and all SS7 and SIP messages. This option
	can be switched without SMSC restart. All the incoming messages into
	SMSC will be tried for delivery first and only if delivery fails,
	it will be persisted for later re-try.
	
	Datagramm and Transactional modes will work in the same way for both normal and fast modes.

Name
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator <due-delay-multiplicator>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a value for due-delay-multiplicator. This parameter 
	specifies the delay multiplicator value before another delivery attempt (after 
	failure) is made. 

	After a message delivery failure (if message validity period is not over and the 
	failure is temporary), a delay period is induced before the next delivery attempt.
	This delay period is calculated as follows: 

	Delay after the first delivery failure = 
				second-due-delay

	Delay after every consecutive delivery failure = 
				prev-due-delay * due-delay-multiplicator / 100 
			        where prev-due-delay is the delay at the previous step.

EXAMPLES
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator 200

	Lets take an example where the First due delay is 60 seconds, Second due delay is
	300 seconds, and the due-delay-multiplicator is 200, the attempts will be made
	as below:

	First attempt will be after 60 seconds (1 min) 
	[delay is configured in First due delay]

	Second attempt will be after 300 seconds (5 min) 
	[delay is configured in Second due delay assuming 
	delivery failed not because of "Subscriber busy"]

	Third attempt will be after 600 sec (10 min) 
	[delay is calculated based on Due delay multiplicator]
	Delay = 300 * 200 / 100	= 600

	Fourth attempt will be after 1200 sec (20 min) 
	[delay is calculated based on Due delay multiplicator]
	Delay = 600 * 200 / 100	= 1200

	Fifth attempt will be after 2400 sec (40 min) 
	[delay is calculated based on Due delay multiplicator]
	Delay = 1200 * 200 / 100 = 2400

SYNOPSIS
        smsc set scgt <globalTitle> networkid <networkId>

DESCRIPTION
        This command is used to set a value for SMSC Global Title.

        networkId - a specifies Global Title for a virtual SS7
        subnetwork (this is for Multi-tenancy support). By using of
        this command with different networkIds you can specify
        Global Titles for several subnetworks. 
        If this parameter is skipped - networkId will be set to "0"
        when Global Title creation (master networkId).
        When we do not specify Global Title for some networkid -
        Global Title for master networkId will be used. When we
        use "0" as Global Title value 
        (like "smsc set scgt 0 networkid <xxx>") -
        this will just clear Global Title for an specified networkid.

        This command is used to set the value of MAP Application Context version. The

        Gateway supports version negotiation. So if you set this to a higher version (say
        for example version 3, however your network only understands version 2), the SMSC Gateway
        will automatically do the version negotiation and exchange V2 messages when V3
        exchange fails. However this causes additional messages to be exchanged and
        increases the overall load on the system. Therefore it is advisable to always set
        the correct version.

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set maxmessagelengthreducer <max-message-length-reducer>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set an integer value for max-message-length-reducer.
	The recommended value is 6. Possible values are numbers from 0 to 12. 

	Empty TC-BEGIN will be used if the message length is greater than the maximum
	possible message length minus the value specified for max-message-length-reducer.

	(message-length > max-possible-message-length - max-message-length-reducer) 

	Empty TC-BEGIN is used in MAP Version 2 and 3 for forwardSM and Mt-ForwardSM 
	requests. In MAP Version 2 the dailog portion
	(ApplicationContextName, MAPOpenInfo primitive) and the component portion 
	(forwardSM and mt-ForwardSM requests) may both together be too long to fit within 
	a MTP message. In Empty TC-BEGIN case, it first sends the dailog portion in 
	TC-BEGIN followed by the component portion in the next TC-CONTINUE. 
	Whether empty TC-BEGIN is used or not depends on the length of a message and the 
	length of SCCP addresses. This option increases the guarantee of delivery of a 
	message  to some network.

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set sriresponselivetime <time in seconds>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a SRI responses Cache Time.

	SMSC GW can store successfull SendRoutinInfo (SRI) responses (with IMSI and
	NetworkNodeNumber data) into an internal cach for some configurable time.
	SMSC GW	parameter "sriresponselivetime" specifies the minimum time value
	for storing of a response. Caching of SRI responses takes some system
	resources and is recommended only if you need it for some scenarious (like
	you send firstly only an SRI request and do not deliver a message just to
	understend IMSI / NetworkNodeNumber (this scenario is achieavable by mproc
	rules) and then send a message in short time if needed). 

DEFAULT VALUE
	0 - this means no caching.

This command will skip of processing / fetching of messages that was scheduled for delivering for the time in the past but have not yet delivered by SMSC GW because of SMSC GW was turned off or overloaded. 
&lt;time in seconds&gt; means the point of the time (actual current time - &lt;time in seconds&gt;) to which the point of processing / fetching of messages will be shifted.
If the value "0" is provided this means SMSC GW will be shifted into an actual (current) time ("in process" due_slot will be shifted to "in time" due_slot).
If the value is positive this means SMSC GW "in process" due_slot will be shifted into a some time in the past (for example if the value is 3600 - to the time before the current time ("in time" due_slot) for 1 hour).
Negative values are not accepted. "In process" due_slot can be shifted only forward. It is not possible to shift "in process" due_slot backward (and resend messages that was already sent once).

DESCRIPTION
	Executing of this command leads SMSC GW to switch "In process" due_slot
	forward to the current time or to some time before the current time.
	This is possible only if there is some lag in message processing by

<para>
RestComm SMSC Gateway supports Non Transparent Home Routing as explained in 3GPP 23.840 5.2.3.
This option can be disabled by setting "hrcharging" option to "reject" (see <xref linkend="dest_hrCharging"/>).
SMSC GW will accept SendRoutinInfo requests from a remote SMSC, then create a unique "correlationId" value for a requested MSISDN, then send SendRoutinInfo request to HLR,
store received by HLR info into a cache and sends back to the remote SMSC SendRoutinInfo response with "correlationId" value in IMSI field and SMSC GlobalTytle
(or another special configured GlobalTytle value) in LocationInfo field. Then SMSC GW will accept MtForwardSM messages from the remote SMSC, seaches in the cache for "correlationId"
and HLR subscriber's and use this data for processing a message further.
</para>

                    <title>Correlation table CC and MCC-MNC for home routing mode managing.</title>
        </section>
<para>
For home routing mode we may need to fill a special table for correlation between CC (CountryCodes) of incoming MSISDN address and MCC-MNC prefix of a generated correlationId value. 
CorrelationId value will be returned as IMSI in SRI response to an upper SMSC GW. As an extra field "smsc" field can be specified for each entry of this table. 
If this field is specified and not empty then this value will be returned as a LocationInfo in SRI response to an upper SMSC GW, else SMSC GW address will be returned.
Correlation table is stored into "jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/&lt;server instanse, for example 'default'&gt;"/data" and has name "SmscManagement_cc_mccmnc.xml".
The content of this should follow the following template:
</para>
<para>
<screen><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <CcMccmncCollection>
  <ccMccmncList>
    <ccMccmnc countryCode="0111" mccMnc="77702"/>
    <ccMccmnc countryCode="0222" mccMnc="9999999"/>
    <ccMccmnc countryCode="02" mccMnc="8888888" smsc="06060606"/>
    <ccMccmnc countryCode="" mccMnc="22323"/>
  </ccMccmncList>
</CcMccmncCollection>
]]></screen>
</para>
<para>
The file structure consists on one or several instances of countryCode / mccMnc pairs.
When SMSC GW reads a correlation table from the file (or when a user add new entries into the table) it sorts it so that the longer CountryCode values (more detailed "CountryCode") are put at first places of the list
then shorter CountryCode values. For example "44779" will be before "44". First found "mccMnc" value will be used for correlationId generating.
When SMSC GW receives a SRI request from an upper SMSC GW it looks throught 
the table, checks if incoming MSISDN digits start from countryCode value from a table entry. 
The last entry in the correlation table must be empty ("") countryCode value. This entry will be used as a default value. All MSISDN that are not fit to any other entries will use mccMnc of the entry of "".
You can also add an optional extra field "smsc" into any record. This value will be used as LocationInfo field in SendRoutinInfo response.
<!---
If you have manually updated the content of SmscManagement_cc_mccmnc.xml file use CLI command "smsc updateccmccmnstable" or a corresponded GUI command (<xref linkend="updateccmccmnstable"/>) for reloading this table from a disc.

<para>
In home routing mode SMSC GW specifies correlationId for any recieved SRI requests from upper SMSC. After it this correlationId value and corresponded to MSISDN data are stored into internal cache and
will be used for processing of next coming MtForwardSM messages from other SMSC. Correlationidlivetime value defines how much time minimum is correlationId in cache.
You can set the 'correlationidlivetime' option by issuing the command
<command>smsc set correlationidlivetime</command> with appropriate parameters as described below.
You can verify this by issuing the command <command>smsc get correlationidlivetime</command> which will display the value set for this property.
</para>
<para>
Also pay attention that when Telestax SMSC delivers messages received under "home routing" procedure SMSC GW will try to reuse location info and IMSI data that SMSC GW has obtained when request to HLR under "home routing" procedure.
SMSC GW will try to reuse this info only till it is kept in correlationId cache. When ForwardAndStore and datagram modes this is usually achived in correlationidlivetime is 60 seconds.
In StoreAndForward mode messages delivery can be started some time after messages have come to SMSC GW. This delay depends on both SMSC GW setting (first delivery attempt) and SMSC GW overloadload rate.
For StoreAndForward mode we need to caluclate a proper correlationidlivetime value depending on othe SMSC setting. But do not make this value too big - this will waste memory and location info can occure too old.
