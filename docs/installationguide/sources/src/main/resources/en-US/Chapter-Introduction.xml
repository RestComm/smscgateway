   <para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is an Open Source Java based SMSC Gateway built on a modern extensible middleware platform. &THIS.PLATFORM; SMSC enables operators to provide core SMSC features like mobile subscriber to subscriber SMS messaging, broadcasting campaigns and group messaging<footnote id="fnrestcomm">
<para>
Group Messaging can be achieved using &THIS.PLATFORM; RestComm. For more details please contact info@telestax.com.
</para>
</footnote> between subscribers. In addition it also enables value added services through integration with OTT social networks and microblogs such as Facebook and Twitter.  
	</para>
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is an easy-to-install and easy-to-deploy platform that can be set up and configured very quickly. Since it is built on a modern and extensible JSLEE platform it automatically provides out-of-the-box integration with various communication protocols such as SIP, Diameter, HTTP, XCAP, XMPP, MGCP and others in addition to the base SMPP protocol for connectivity to ESMEs. 
	</para>
	<para>
&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; stores messages using Cassandra database. The database is used for storing unsent messages, messages successfully sent and messages that failed to be sent.
	</para>
<para>
		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is cloud-ready. It can be deployed on dedicated hardware, private cloud infrastructure or public laaS such as AWS. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports TDM hardware offered by major vendors in the market, namely Intel family boards (Dialogic) and 
		Zaptel/Dahdi (Digium, Sangoma). TeleStax also has in-house SS7 cards also known as RestComm SS7 Cards. RestComm SS7 cards have MTP2/3 support on-board and therefore the processing load on the server hosting the 
		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; platform will be low when you use these SS7 cards.    
	</para>

<para>
A single &THIS.PLATFORM; SMSC node can process up to 1000 SMS/sec. Multiple SMSC nodes can be arranged in a cluster across one or more geographically distributed data centers to scale up throughput and provide various levels of redundancy, high availability and fault tolerance.
</para>
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		is based on the robust and proven &THIS.PLATFORM;
		JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and &THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 Stack.
	&THIS.PLATFORM;
		JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment. It provides a set of connectors to a
		variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, CAP, INAP, TCAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others. It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1).
	&THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol. It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. &THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack.
