Name
    smsc set smppencodingforucs2

SYNOPSIS
    smsc set smppencodingforucs2 <UTF8|UNICODE|GSM7>

DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to set the Encoding Scheme at SMPP side for
    UCS2 encoding (DCS = 8).

    At the SMPP side, messages accept 3 different encoding schemes namely UTF8,
    UNICODE and GSM7 (8-bit), for both sending and receiving messages. The SMSC
    can be configured to accept one of them (the one that ESME supports). If this
    is not set, then the default encoding sheme is UTF8. For GSM8 encoding 
    (DCS = 4), no charset encoding made in the SMSC. 

EXAMPLES
	smsc set smppencodingforucs2 unicode
