Name
	smsc set removingarchivetabledays

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set removingarchivetabledays <value>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to configure the SMSC to automatically drop ARCHIVE tables 
	from the Cassandra Database. The SMSC will attempt to delete tables just after
	midnight and after every SMSC restart.

PARAMETERS
	removingarchivetabledays	- This parameter is used to specify the number
					  of days the ARCHIVE tables should be kept before 
					  attempting to drop them automatically.

					  If this value is specified as "0", the SMSC
					  will not drop tables automatically. In this case
					  you must manually drop tables.

					  You must specify a value of 3 or more. You can
					  not set this value to 1 or 2 days. This is to 
					  ensure the tables will be kept for a minimum
					  of 2 days after creation date.

					  The SMSC wil attempt to delete tables for one 
					  day. If the Cassandra Database keeps tables for 
					  older days, then the administrator should drop 
					  these manually.
